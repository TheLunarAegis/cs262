a.	The Trello page shows much more activity than my group's.

b.	The user interface model shows a great concept for a user interface.
	It may not be super polished, but that's not what we're going for right now.
	I don't understand why they have a link to the main activity from the sidebar,
		unless they plan on renaming it to "logout"
	
	The User stories are very straight and to the point, no fluff.
	(playing stupid here \/ )
	What does "Elo" stand for?  Maybe just a quick definition in the model.
	For the user, do they need some place to have their scores for specific sports stored?
		Right now it just looks like they only store wins, losses, upcomming matches,
		email, and best sport.  No links to specific sport rankings per player.
		It looks like the score is stored in the elo, but the user has no connection to it.
	
c.	It looks like no new commits since Sunday.
	I could not get the app to run, however that could be my own user error.
		Maybe a quick refresher on github durring class or lab?

d.	Usability section looks too generic, all apps should be easy to pick up and use.
	Looks like they're being too ambitious with the touch gestures.
	
	Readability could be condensed into one main point:
		The response time should be 2 seconds or less.
	All other points in this section are either intuitive or repetative.
	
	Supportablitity is good
	
	Preformance Working well under stress is a bit ambitous but I don't know the limitations.
	For on mulitple devices, are we talking the same account or just multiple people on at
		the same time?
	should always be the most updated, should be for all apps unless old data is needed.
