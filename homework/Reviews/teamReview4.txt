The user test of Team: Pilot was very well organized.  I showed up to the lab
and they were sitting there ready for me to start testing.  One member was
still resetting the app from the previous user, and the other gave me the
starting talk about the app.  However, when I got my hands on the app, a lot
of functionality was missing, but the interface was working.  There were only
a few setting that worked and not much of the backend worked at all.  I even
ran into a dead-end with the app, stuck on a screen with no back arrow.


There are about 18 commits since last week, and assuming everyone commited the
same amount, that's about 3 commits per person.  I'd say that's a good amount
of commits.
