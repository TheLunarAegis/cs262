A.	This app seems like it could be very popular in the Calvin Videogame Sphere club.
	The vision statement is unclear as to it is a solo or team (or both) ranking.
	I think this will not be an easy app to make but has a lot of potential.
	I like the vision statement. It sparked the competative gamer inside me.

B.	It is there.
	It is documented.
	It's way farther along than my group's code.
