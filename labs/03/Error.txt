So, I went through the lab exercise and i got to the end of 2.4 on the website.
My code errored out and said something about "R"
I asked the Professor in class and he suggested I start over or submit what I have.
I started over and got to the same point and the same thing happened again.
I have no idea how to fix this and I have no time to redo this again.
I would've finished the code if there was no error, but I have no idea what to do at this point.

I'm sorry I have no screenshot to submit from my phone,
but I did submit a screenshot of the error.
My code will be on github.
